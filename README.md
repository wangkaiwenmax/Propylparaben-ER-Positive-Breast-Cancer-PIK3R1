# Propylparaben-ER-Positive-Breast-Cancer-PIK3R1
This study integrates network toxicology with TCGA data to identify propylparaben-related carcinogenic targets. PPI networks and machine learning screen core genes, ROC and MR assess diagnostic and causal relevance, while molecular docking and ssGSEA explore PP–PIK3R1 binding and immune infiltration.
